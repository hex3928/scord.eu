3. Install dependencies `npm i`
4. Build the CSS with `npm run build:css`
5. Run the dev server `npm run dev` (then visit it on localhost - the default port is 5000) or build the production version by first enabling purge in `src/tailwind/config.js`, rebuilding the CSS and building the bundle `npm run build`
